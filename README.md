# InstagramChecker

Check who has unfollowed you or switch the two lists around of "scum_bags = list(set(followers_list) - set(following_list))" to check who you don't follow back.

An Instagram bot that checks who doesnt follow you back this is done by comparing followers to following and looking for the diffrence in the two sets.


# Requirements:

*Python 2 or 3

*Chrome Web Driver

*Selimum

*A perfect connection with no interrupting this is more true for large followers or followings were its very diffcult for the bot to get all followers or followings names and were a lot of time is taken.



Please be aware this code may not work sometimes and fail due to Instagram keep changing they website code which can cause problems so Xpaths must be changed and checked before hand the concept still applies though .
